The definition of computer here is to utilize massive computing power but not limit it to show a few nav-boxes.

Here is XCMania:
 
- Team Fly - always stay online, as low as 1k ~ 25k data transfer per pilot per hour, team pilots would alway on your XC screen while flying no matter how far away they are. And there is a one-click retrieve button.
- The first flight computer shows real time 3D thermal shape. Yes, you do have a powerful GPU in hand.
- Mania Circle helps you to visualize thermal hunting range.
- Thermal meter helps you lock down the core, is this circle better than the last one or is it faded out.
- Intuitive design, this is 2020, try not to be an old kinky black box with 196 pages of manual.
